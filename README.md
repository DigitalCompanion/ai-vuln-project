# Vulnerability finder project

Repo contains vulnerability research papers and code for AI driven vulnerabililty testing

The initial phase is open and consists of collecting research and other useful information, both manually and by using a machine learning model tuned to find relevant domain information.


Take special note of the licensing of individual files collected in this repo, kudos to the respective authors.

More information will be available as the project progress.
